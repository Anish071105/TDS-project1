#An explanation of how I scraped the data 
I scraped the data using Python scripts in google colab that leveraged the GitHub API to fetch users in Melbourne with over 100 followers and their public repositories, utilizing rate limiting and pagination to avoid API restrictions.Paging means dividing API responses into smaller chunks and Limiting means restricting requests to avoid hitting API rate limits.
